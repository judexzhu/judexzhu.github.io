## Docker Overview

Docker is container technique overall. 

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker is designed to deliver your applications faster.With Docker you can separate your applications from your infrastructure and treat your infrastructure like a managed application. Docker helps you ship code faster, test faster, deploy faster, and shorten the cycle between writing code and running code.
Docker does this by combining **kernel containerization** features with workflows and tooling that help you manage and deploy your applications.
